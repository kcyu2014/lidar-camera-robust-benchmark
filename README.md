# Code of "Benchmarking the Robustness of LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection"
Here, we will release the toolkit to convert a clean LiDAR-camera dataset into a robustness benchmark. In detail, we release two example files for Waymo and nuScences dataset first.

We will post the general toolkit.

## Release note
- [x] Toolkit for Waymo Open dataset
- [x] Toolkit for nuScences dataset
- [ ] Generic toolkit for arbitrary dataset.
